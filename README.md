Wow, just got out of Silent Zone and my mind's like a blender left on high – bits of kale and banana everywhere. I mean, what even happened? It’s like one part was trying to be a Shakespearean tragedy and the other part felt like 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 paint dry... but in 3D. There are these characters running around with emotions so big, you’d think they were carrying them in wheelbarrows. There were scenes where I was thinking, “Okay, I get it, you’re sad. Can we move on now?”

> There was this one bit, where the protagonist did something so boneheaded, I nearly laughed out loud. Like, really? Maybe the director was going for “deep” and just missed entirely, like a cat trying to catch a shadow. Not that I didn’t enjoy parts of it. The soundtrack was pretty killer; it actually helped remind me I was supposed to be emotionally invested. And don’t even get me started on the makeup design – as a makeup artist myself, it was a real “nose up against the glass” moment. They’ve got this one character with a look so sharp, I'm surprised it didn’t come with a “warning: may cut you” sign. God bless the genius with the eyeliner.

But, man, some dialogue made me cringe in all the right ways... and then the wrong ways. It’s like if life gave lemons, but instead of making lemonade, you just eat the lemons and hope no one notices you wincing.

def dramatic_turns():
    for scene in scenes:
        if 'overacted' in scene:
            return 'C’mon, really?'
    return 'Surprisingly okay'

Would I 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it again? Gosh, it’s like asking if I want a second helping of a mystery casserole. Maybe if I’m in just the right mood and someone else suggests it. Or maybe next time I’ll just 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   for the soundtrack while I do some smokey eyes for kicks. Decisions, decisions. But hey, if you're feeling adventurous or just need to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 something that’ll make you talk to yourself for an hour after, you know where to look.
